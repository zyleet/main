== Introduction
=== The Product
DEGREES.NUS is a desktop application developed to help *prospective applicants of NUS Faculty of Engineering* view, choose and manage engineering degrees, modules, and course events in a coherent and systematic manner.

DEGREES.NUS offers various functionalities that range from comparing the details of two different engineering degrees, to adding and sorting these degrees into a personalised list and viewing past statistics of the degrees. Moreover, as a task manager, DEGREES.NUS is suitable to be used as a personal assistant as it lets you organise and remind you of the important tasks pertaining to university application, such as document submission deadlines or freshman events.

DEGREES.NUS specifically fits users who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of an appealing Graphical User Interface (GUI). Also, if you are particularly adept at typing fast, DEGREES.NUS will handle your commands more quickly than traditional GUI apps. 

=== The Document
The DEGREES.NUS Team is committed to ensuring that you have all the information you need for using this application as effortlessly as possible. Therefore, this document describes all aspects of using DEGREES.NUS including installation, features, and commands. We have also included a Frequently Asked Questions if you have any doubts about the application after going through the document. 

To use DEGREES.NUS, you should have some basic knowledge of downloading, installing and running applications. You should also able to input simple text commands into a command line. You will not need any other technical knowledge to use the application to its fullest potential.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words enclosed in `<>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `delete <ID>`, `<ID>` is a parameter which can be used as `delete 4`.
* Items in square brackets represent tabs e.g `[Help]` signifies the help tab. As a rule, any changes to any of the tabs should automatically open that tab.
* Items separated by `|` can be used either way. e.g `detail <DEGREE> | detail` can be used as `detail ceg` or as simply `detail`.
* Items in curly brackets are optional e.g `event MISTA /at DD-MM-YYYY HHmm {/priority High}` can be used as `event MISTA /at 04-04-2004 0444` or as `event MISTA /at 04-04-2004 0444 /priority High`.

=== Viewing Helpful Commands : `help | help <COMMAND>` [[help]]
To view a full list of possible commands that DEGREES.NUS understands, you can call the help command. +
It will also switch to the `[Help]` tab if you prefer to view the commands in tabular format.



The displayed commands can be entered after help in the format `help <command>` to find more details on the usage if the given command. 


[NOTE]
`help <command>` will not switch tabs, as we feel its overkill to display help for all commands when all you need is one.

Format: `help | help <command>`

Examples: +

* `help add` +
Displays information for the `add` command.
* `help tasks` +
Displays information for the `tasks` command.
* `help` +
Displays information for ALL possible commands and switches to the `[Help]` tab.

How it will be displayed with just `help`: +

=== Display keywords and aliases that are compatible with <DEGREE>: `keywords`

Displays all keywords and their aliases for each degree. +
This will switch to the `[Keywords]` tab. +
These keywords and aliases are compatible with usages of <DEGREE>. +
However `view_employment` and `cohort_size` only uses keywords.

Format: `keywords` 

How it will be displayed: +

=== Viewing detailed information about a degree: `detail | detail <DEGREE>`

Lists all the module information associated with a degree. +
It will also switch to the `[Degree Information]` tab. 

`<DEGREE>` accepts keywords and aliases.


[TIP]
All <DEGREE> usages are case insensitive. e.g `ceg` will match `CEG`. This applies to `compare` and `add` as well.


If you wish to simply switch tabs, `detail` can be used on its own. +

Format: `detail | detail <DEGREE>` +

Examples: +

* `detail bme` +
Displays module information for Biomedical Engineering.
* `detail Computer Engineering` +
Displays module information for Computer Engineering.

****
* The indices must be positive integers. This applies to all usages of <ID>.
* The degree at first <ID> will be replaced by the degree at the second <ID> and vice-versa.
* The order of indices doesn't matter i.e. `swap 1 5` will have the same functionality as `swap 5 1`.

=== Undoing a command: `undo`

You can undo previous commands if you are not happy with the changes. +
This only works for commands that modifies your task or degree lists. +

Format: `undo`

=== Redoing a command: `redo`

You can also redo previous undone commands if you wish to revert back the undo. Redo will reset when a new command is entered. +

Format: `redo`

=== Exiting the program: `bye`

Exits the program after a short delay. +

Format: `bye`

=== Saving the data

Task and degree choice data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
This includes undo and redo commands. +
There is no need to save manually. +

The save data is located in the `data` folder one level above the jar file. +
`save.txt` is for task data, `savedegree.txt` is for degree choice data. +

If there is no `data` folder detected (i.e. after a fresh download), the jar file will generate a fresh one with empty save files. +

=== Auto suggests commands based on frequency

DEGREES.NUS will suggest commands based on the frequency you have used certain commands. Pressing kbd:[&#8594;] will fill the rest of the displayed command. +
If you wish to exit the current auto suggestion box, press kbd:[Esc].

=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

We will use enigma to encode the save file. It is hard for enigma cyphers to be decoded by humans, therefore it acts as deterrence only.

<<<
== FAQ

*Q*: Where are my save files located? +
*A*: The `data` folder containing your save data is located one level above the jar file. They are called `save.txt` and `savedegree.txt`. We do not recommend modifying these files unless you know what you are doing.

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Place the jar in another computer. Running it for the first time will create a `data` folder containing 2 empty save files. Overwrite these save files with the save files from your previous DEGREES.NUS `data` folder. +

*Q*: Why can't I find information regarding this degree? +
*A*: If your course is not offered by the Faculty of Engineering, chances are our program does not support it. We do intend to expand our app to eventually include all courses in NUS, but for now only 9 Engineering degrees are supported.

*Q*: Why can't I resize the cli? +
*A*: This is deliberate as resizing the cli will break the formatting of the text displayed in the cli, particularly for commands `detail` and `command`. Resizing the window will only resize the tables.

*Q*: Is this compatible with mac os? +
*A*: Yes. Installation instructions are the same for both Windows and Mac.

*Q*: Is this compatible with linux? +
*A*: No. We are prioritising expanding our app to support other degrees, so linux support will not come so soon.

*Q*: Is there an ios or android version? +
*A*: No. Similar to the linux question, we are prioritising expanding our app to support other degrees, so this app will not be available on other platforms for some time.

*Q*: Is this program free? +
*A*: Yes. We intend to keep this app free and open-source, as we feel this tool should be available to all students and prospective students.
