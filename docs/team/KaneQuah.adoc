== PROJECT: DEGREES.NUS

---

== Overview

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into an application which is able to display information about NUS Degrees (from the Faculty of Engineering). This enhanced application enables prospective students to view the modules they would be required to take for a particular degree; manage degree applications and inform them of upcoming events related to NUS Open Houses; and even details the differences in (Modular) content between any 2 degrees.

This is what our project looks like:

My role was to design and write the code for the Degrees and Storage features. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.
Enhancement added: I added an entire package devoted to containing the information of modules of various types. In addition, I added the Degrees class which leverages upon these modules. 

• What it does: The module package contains 4 classes. 2 of these 4 classes are extended from a parent Module class, and the fourth class is a container with enhanced comparing functionalities.  Degrees utilizes these module classes, however it sets its own restrictions on what kind of modules are valid. 

• Justification: In the event that the university has broader or more varied module selection, the parent class can be extended. In addition, the Degrees class decides which type of Modules should be used, allowing administrators to set rules for faculties submitting their modular programme requirements. 

• Highlights: There is a parent class Module and that the other two types of Modules are extended from them. This allows future developers to make extensions to this class to suit their module needs. An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to determine a future-proof solution; thus it was decided to implement a basic Module class which is comparable. This makes it such that it is possible for future extensions of the module class to remain comparable to older or more basic versions. This implementation was also challenging because it is not the module class which determines what type of module codes and strings are valid (that being the job of the Degree class). Therefore, it was difficult to create an implementation of three different module types which maintained comparability yet had distinctions between them.

• Credits: Most of this work was self-created. I have heavily referenced Oracle JavaDocs in order to find suitable data structures for the ModuleList class.

Other contributions: 
• Project management: o There were a total of 5 releases, from version 1.1 to 1.3. I managed release version 1.1 (1 release) on GitHub. 

• Enhancements to existing features: 
o Made changes to the pre-existing Storage class in order for stricter file validation as well as ease of files finding. (#87)

• Documentation: 
o Taught other members about adoc features.
o Guided members to online resources for adoc.

• Storage: 
o Advised other group members on how to use the Storage class to fetch and store data.
o Made recommendations to create storage friendly output to other members utilizing the storage class.
o Ensured that the main save file would initialize safely even if not found or the file name given was incorrect. (#87)

• Data: 
o Made recommendations for utilizing certain symbols or phrases in order to demarcate different sections of data when saving.
o Initialized the file read and writing functions, following safe or good practices in doing so. (#4)
o Scraped data from official public NUS degree pages listing the information. (#87)

=== Comparing two degrees: `compare | compare <DEGREE> <DEGREE>`[[compare]]

Lists the module similarities and differences between two degree programs given their keywords. +
Will also switch tabs to the `[Degree Differences]` tab. 

`<DEGREE>` accepts keywords and aliases and is case insensitive. 


`compare` can also be used on its own to simply switch tabs. +

Format: `compare | compare <DEGREE> <DEGREE>`

Example: +

* `compare ceg bme` +
Compares between Computer Engineering and Biomedical Engineering.
* `compare Industrial and Systems Engineering Environmental Engineering` +
Compares between Industrial and Systems Engineering and Environmental Engineering.
* `compare` +
Switches to the `[Degree Differences]` tab.

How it will be displayed: +

=== DegreeManager Feature
==== Implementation

DegreeManager a class which contains the ModuleList class and Map of Strings to Degrees. When being constructed, it looks for a list of degrees in Storage class and then proceeds to attempt to load every degree.

`Degree#print(String input)`: This functions takes in the input string and checks if it matches any alias of any degree. If a match was found, it will call that degree's print function in order to print the degree's details.

`DegreeManager#isKey(String alias)`: This function takes in a string and verifies it against all aliases. It will return true for the first alias it matches to, false if there were no matches at all.

`DegreeManager#findAnyKey(String degreeName)`: This function takes in a string and returns the valid degree key if any. An empty string is returned if a degree cannot be matched to the input. The key is used to access the correct Degree in the map of Strings to Degrees.

`DegreeManager#twoKeyGenerator(String[] split)`: This function takes in an array of Strings. The array is then partitioned into two segments, each containing at least one String, white space is padded between each element. The corresponding partitions are run through a check for validity. If both partitions are successfully matched to a degree, degreeOneKey and degreeTwoKey (two String variables in DegreeManager) will hold the respective information collected. If both degree keys are unique, the result of the comparison between the two degrees will be printed.

`DegreeManager#compare(String input)`: This function takes in an input string. The input string is then split into an Array of Strings (separated by whitespace). The resultant array is then passed to twoKeyGenerator. If two unique keys were generated and then stored in DegreeManager, DegreeManager will use degreeOneKey and degreeTwoKey in order to invoke a comparison of the first degree to the second. 

Given below is the UML Diagram relating how DegreeManager is linked to the main() logic as well as how it utilizes Degree and Storage when being initialized

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F10-2/main/master/docs/images/DegreeManagerInit.png[width="900", align = "left"]

As detailed in the diagram above, when the main logic is initialized, an instance of Duke is created. Duke will subsequently create a Storage class. Duke will then create DegreeManager which will use Duke's instance of Storage. DegreeManager will fetch the information regarding the list of degrees from Storage. Subsequently, for each degree in the list, it will create a Degree class to be stored within itself.

==== Design Considerations

How DegreeManager handles the checking of valid degree names:

* Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Iteration through every possible alias and checking if it matches
** Pros: 
*** Trivial to implement
*** It is readable.
*** Suitable for small and fixed number of aliases such as the current version of this program.
** Cons: 
*** It is not the best or most efficient way.

* Alternative 2: Creation of Disjoint Set to find aliases.
** Pros: 
*** Extremely efficient Data Structure, O(4) time in searching for an entry.
*** Can be used to instantly determine if two keys belong to the same set as well.
*** Becomes faster over time through usage of Path Compression techniques.
** Cons: 
*** Non-primitive storage container, requires self implementation which may be flawed.
*** Complicated to use when handling non-integer members.
*** Extra Containers and functions needed to support the Disjoint Set.
