## Status

Currently, this project only has support for 9 degrees in the NUS Faculty of Engineering. We plan to expand and eventually include all degrees and courses available in NUS, and maybe even include other Universities in Singapore. We also plan to add automatic scrapping of course and module information from the NUS database to reduce the workload on the development team and to ensure that the course information is always up-to-date.
